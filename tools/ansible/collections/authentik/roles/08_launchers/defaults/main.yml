# Launcher App Configurations
# Apps that appear in Authentik library but handle their own SSO
# These create applications with meta_launch_url (no provider needed)
#
# Use for:
# - Apps with native Google OAuth SSO
# - Apps with their own authentication
# - External apps you want in your app directory
#
# Options:
#   groups: [] - restrict visibility to specific groups (creates policy binding)
#   icon: Local icon filename from files/icons/ (uploaded to Authentik)
---
# Alphabetical order for consistent UI display
